More About Me

I started my technical career about five years ago, and it’s been quite a journey. 
Growing up in the South Bronx as the second oldest of seven, I wasn’t immediately familiar with the 
concept of “opportunity” — at least not in the way I understand it now. 
But my passion for reading and learning has always been a driving force for me. I’m constantly asking, "Why?" and this curiosity 
has led me to dive deeper into technology and problem-solving.

As I continue to grow in my career, I strive to positively impact my peers, inspire those who’ve struggled with doubt, and 
foster environments where knowledge sharing and collaborative learning are priorities.

I'm deeply invested in continuous learning and enjoy taking on complex challenges. At the moment, I’m expanding my skills in 
PowerShell, SQL, and C#, always seeking new ways to enhance my technical toolkit. Whether it's coding problems, logic puzzles, 
or systems design, I love finding creative solutions and improving efficiencies.

Outside of tech, I’m an avid reader with a special interest in suspense and thrillers. 
I enjoy the thrill of solving mysteries before they unfold—anticipating twists and deciphering clues. 
This passion for puzzles and uncovering answers translates into my professional life, where I focus on 
innovative problem-solving and optimizing workflows.
